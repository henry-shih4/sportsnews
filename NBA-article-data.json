Turner also had nine rebounds and four assists against a Bucks squad that was missing two injured All-Stars, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard.\nIt's unclear if either will be available in Game 5.

That rebuild paid off in a major way this past season, as the Thunder finished with a 57-20 record and secured the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference.\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander cemented his status as one of the best players in the NBA \u2014 becoming an MVP finalist \u2014 second-year players Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams took a major leap in the frontcourt, and fellow starters Lu Dort and Josh Giddey continued to show off their two-way abilities under Daigneault's tutelage. All five regular Thunder starters averaged double-digit points per game during the regular season.\nClutch Player of the Year: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\nThe 10-time NBA All-Star and four-time NBA champion finished first in points (189), made field goals (59) and made 3-pointers (32) in the clutch this season, defined by the NBA as the last five minutes of a game in which the score is within five points.\nCurry shot 49.6% from the field and 45.7% from 3-point range in these scenarios, and the Warriors were 23-20 with him in the lineup.\nIn February, the two-time NBA MVP became the first player to reach 3,600 career 3-pointers. The 36-year-old will join Team USA men's basketball this summer in Paris for his Olympic debut.\u00a0\nSixth Man of the Year: Naz Reid, Minnesota Timberwolves\nNaz Reid flourished off the bench for the Minnesota Timberwolves this season, averaging 13.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game \u2014 all career-highs \u2014 in 24.2 minutes per game. Reid also notably shot 41.4% from 3-point range on 5.0 attempts per game. A little less than half of his field goal attempts came from beyond the arc.\nReid beat out Sacramento Kings guard Malik Monk for the award. Monk was the betting favorite to win at -280, followed by Reid at +230. Monk led the league in points off of the bench with 15.4 PPG.\nMost Improved Player: Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers\nFollowing the Sixers' trade of James Harden to the Clippers in October 2023, Maxey quickly became the No. 2 scorer on the team behind reigning league MVP Joel Embiid while also blossoming into his role as Philadelphia's starting point guard. The 23-year-old former first-round pick out of Kentucky was named to his first All-Star game in February, and averaged 25.9 points, 6.2 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game in the 2023-24 regular season.\nMaxey, who was +1100 in betting odds to win the Most Improved Player award before the season, has three 50-plus point games in his career, with his latest being a 52-point performance in April against the San Antonio Spurs. He finished the season averaging 25.9 points and 6.2 assists per game, helping the Sixers reach the playoffs again as the No. 7 seed after beating the Miami Heat in the play-in tournament.\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?\u00a0Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily.]\n", "description": "Follow along here as the NBA's standout players are honored for their individual accomplishments during 2023-24 NBA awards season!", "hero_img": "https://statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/4.17.23_NBA-Awards-Tracker_16x9.jpeg", "thumbnail": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/128/72/4.17.23_NBA-Awards-Tracker_16x9.jpeg", "category": "NBA", "date": "Sun, 28 Apr 2024 19:49:50 -0400", "comments": []}, {"title": "Clippers hang on beat Mavericks 116-111 after blowing 31-point lead", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/clippers-hang-on-beat-mavericks-116-111-after-blowing-31-point-lead", "content": "Paul George and James Harden each scored 33 points while playing key fourth-quarter roles to help the Los Angeles Clippers hold on after blowing a 31-point lead and beat the Dallas Mavericks 116-111 on Sunday, evening the first-round series at 2-2.\nThe Clippers won again without Kawhi Leonard, who missed the series opener with right knee inflammation before playing in the two Dallas victories.\nThe teams have split a pair on each other's home court in the third Western Conference first-round meeting between them in the past five seasons. Game 5 is Wednesday night in Los Angeles.\nKyrie Irving scored 40 points for Dallas, including an acrobatic layup with 2:15 remaining for a 104-103 lead that was the first for the Mavericks since the middle of the first quarter.\nLuka Doncic had 29 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in his fourth career playoff triple-double \u2014 all against the Clippers.\nGeorge scored 26 points in the first half, when the Clippers' lead reached 55-24 on a 3-pointer by Harden.

But the All-Star center, who has been dealing with lingering problems from his surgically repaired left knee that he appeared to reinjure after a dunk in Game 1, and was recently diagnosed with Bell's palsy, a form of facial paralysis, couldn't muster a basket in the fourth quarter.\nEmbiid finished with 27 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Tyrese Maxey added 23 points for the 76ers, who will try to force another game at home, which would be Thursday.\nNot that the 76ers had much of a home-court advantage Sunday. Knicks fans were all over the arena and gave Brunson louder chants of \"MVP! MVP!\" than Embiid \u2014 who won the award last season \u2014 received from the home fans.\nBrunson earned every one of them on a day some of his usual support couldn't get going.\nJosh Hart missed all seven shots and Donte DiVincenzo missed his first seven. But Hart grabbed 17 rebounds and the Knicks kept going after missed shots, especially when it was clear Embiid didn't have the energy to keep chasing them, and scored 21 second-chance points.\nBrunson was in the locker room to start the fourth quarter but returned to hit a basket over Embiid during a 6-0 Knicks run that gave them the lead for good and made it 86-81. He had another basket that made it 95-89 with 55 seconds remaining and the Knicks closed it out.\nEmbiid scored 50 points, his postseason best, to lead the 76ers to a victory in Game 3, He had them off to a great start in Game 4 but Brunson soon became the dominant player on the floor, the first time All-Star finishing 18 of 34 from the field.\nBrunson's shot was off the in the two games in New York but whatever was working for the Sixers against in New York is gone now. The point guard had 39 on Thursday and was confidently getting to his spots in Game 4, looking like the player who was fourth in the NBA in scoring with 28.7 per game.\nEmbiid tried to keep pace. With 76ers Hall of Famers Julius Erving and Allen Iverson sitting behind the baseline, the Sixers' current star showed how much the current Philadelphia team needs him on the floor. But without getting a rest he wilted late and finished 7 for 19.\nBrunson had a 41-point game for Dallas against Utah in 2022 and another for the Knicks last year against Miami, but that one came in the Game 6 where the Knicks' season ended.\nHe wouldn't let them lose Sunday and a crowd that seemed split between big Northeast cities had a decidedly Knicks sound down the stretch.\nThe Knicks played without backup center Mitchell Robinson because of a sprained left ankle, then lost reserve swingman Bojan Bogdanovic to a bruised left ankle after Nicolas Batum fell on him chasing a loose ball after barely a minute of playing time.\nSo the Knicks relied on the guys they had, with Anunoby playing 47 minutes, Hart 46 and Brunson 43.\nThe 76ers led by 10 after one quarter. But Philadelphia couldn't get anything going offensively with Embiid on the bench to start the second and New York capitalized.\nThe Knicks held the 76ers without a field goal while outscoring them 12-2 to begin the period, with Brunson's basket shortly after Embiid returned tying it at 29. Maxey hit a 3-pointer for Philadelphia's first basket of the period nearly halfway through it, but five consecutive points by Brunson moved New York back into the lead at 34-32.\nThe 76ers regained the lead and were ahead 49-47 at halftime.\nPhiladelphia went up by double digits again in the third before a couple bad turnovers halted their momentum and DiVincenzo finally got going with consecutive 3-pointers.\nReporting by The Associated Press.\n", "description": "Jalen Brunson scored a career playoff-high 47 points, leading the New York Knicks to a 3-1 lead over the Philadelphia 76ers in their first-round playoff series.", "hero_img": "https://statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/brunson-knicks.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/128/72/brunson-knicks.jpg", "category": "NBA", "date": "Sun, 28 Apr 2024 17:30:29 -0400", "comments": []}, {"title": "The Lakers avoided a sweep.

When asked if he had a talk with LeBron James about not allowing that to happen again, he said words weren't necessary.\u00a0\n\"I just think there was a feeling in the room starting in yesterday's film session,\" Davis said. \"It sucks to get swept. Nobody wants that feeling, especially going into the summer. You have to have that feeling for the rest of the summer.\"\nThe Lakers might have avoided the embarrassment of the proverbial broom, but they still have an incredibly steep road ahead. No team in NBA history has ever recovered from a 3-0 series deficit.\u00a0\nConsidering the Lakers hadn't beaten the Nuggets in 499 days, mounting that type of a run seems unlikely. That being said, the Lakers did something Saturday that they hadn't been able to do this series: Hold their lead.\nThe Lakers blew a 12-point advantage in Game 1, a 20-point lead in Game 2 and a 12-point lead in Game 3. Their kryptonite? Third quarters. So, when they led by as much as 13 points in the first half, it seemed as though fans were holding their breath when they took the court again after halftime.\u00a0\nBut the Lakers pushed their advantage to as much as 19 points in the fourth quarter and never trailed. The biggest difference was that Davis and James finally had some help. D'Angelo Russell, who was 0-for-7 in Game 3, had 21 points, four rebounds and four assists. And Austin Reaves poured in 21 points and got six assists.\nThis series shouldn't be so lopsided as it is, considering the Lakers have led for 136 minutes and 31 seconds, while the Nuggets have only been ahead for 41 minutes and 53 seconds.\nEvery third quarter except for Saturday, the Lakers have looked discombobulated and stunned that the reigning NBA champions, who have a two-time MVP in Nikola Joki\u0107 and a postseason superstar in Jamal Murray, emerge from their locker room with a sense of urgency.\u00a0\nThis time, the Lakers matched their energy, only getting outscored 32-30 in the period that has marked their downfall. Lakers coach Darvin Ham chalked up the difference to focus.\u00a0\n\"Not becoming stagnant,\" Ham said. \"Just continuing with our pace, continuing getting stops. We got a bunch of dominant stops and then we got some timely stops. They hit some tough shots, got some and-ones. And we didn't hang our head.\"\nIt would've been a bit of a shame had the Lakers been swept considering James' and Davis' performances these playoffs.\nJames has continued to defy time, finishing with 30 points in Game 4, including scoring 14 in the fourth quarter. He entered Game 4 averaging 26.3 points, 9.7 assists and 6.7 rebounds this postseason.\nAs for Davis, he has averaged 30.5 points and a playoff career-high 15.7 rebounds against Jokic this round. And on Saturday, he aggressively attacked the paint, dunking, finessing and using force to impose his will on both ends of the court.\u00a0\n\"I\u00a0think AD doesn't have to prove anything to anybody,\" James said. \"He's one of the best bigs we have in the game, one of the best bigs in the world. And he's showing that again through the first four games.\"\nJust ask Jordan, who was so impressed by Davis that he had to stop his father in a hallway.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Davis' father patiently waited to congratulate his son, who played a career-high 76 games this season and helped shed the injury-prone narrative that has plagued him.\u00a0\nNow, he has an even greater challenge ahead.\u00a0\nWhatever happens, at least he'll have a better taste in his mouth after Saturday.\u00a0\nMelissa Rohlin is an NBA writer for FOX Sports.

I haven't given it much thought,\" James told reporters when asked how he would handle his decision about playing in the 2024-25 season. James added that he'll have to discuss with his agent Rich Paul and his family what's best for him moving forward. Then he was asked if he had played his final game as a member of the Lakers.\n\"I'm not going to answer that,\" James said, ending his press conference on Monday after that question.\nThe 39-year-old James has a $51.4 million player option for next season which he'll have to make a decision on by June 29. That's part of the reason why it isn't a guarantee James will be back with the Lakers next season. He also contemplated retirement last offseason, and his eldest son, Bronny, has declared for the NBA Draft. LeBron has said in the past that playing with Bronny is one of the last things he wants to accomplish in his playing career.\nJames' comment following Monday's season-ending loss left FOX Sports' Keyshawn Johnson a little worried for the Lakers, asking at the start to not \"have us twiddling our thumbs\" to find out what he wants to do. However, Johnson also believes the Lakers should be cautious in how they approach the situation with James this offseason, believing they have to \"look at the big picture\" before making him a three-year, $164 million max offer.\n\"They've also got to look at where LeBron's at in his career; 21 seasons going on 22 to tie Vince Carter for the most seasons played in the NBA,\" Johnson said on Tuesday's \"Undisputed.\" \"Do you want to commit the type of dollars to someone who, I don't want to call him an aging star because he's still a superstar, but is getting older and there's a risk he can slow down?\"\nJohnson added that if the Lakers bring James back, they'll likely be starting \"all over again,\" as reports suggest Darvin Ham will be ousted as their head coach.\u00a0\nStill, Johnson would still like to see James and Anthony Davis remain in Tinseltown. Paul Pierce thinks that will be the case.\u00a0\n\"He'll be back,\" Pierce said. \"If the Lakers are smart, they'll give him a new three-year deal. He's still playing at a high level. His family uprooted here. His businesses are here. Will he entertain going somewhere else? I don't think so. If he goes to, let's say, Golden State or Cleveland, I just think that would be a little smear on his legacy if he tried to form another super-team and teamed up with Steph Curry or brought Kevin Durant over here.\"\nSkip Bayless agreed with Pierce, saying it's \"much ado about nothing\" due to the James family embracing Los Angeles as their home since he signed with the team in 2018. He also believes the Lakers will do their part to make sure that James doesn't leave Los Angeles this summer.\u00a0\n\"His son is going to be a Laker,\" Bayless said. \"I'll bet you on it because Klutch (the agency that represents James) will make it happen. Klutch will send out the message, \u2018Don't draft this kid because he's going to be a Laker.' I don't think the Lakers are going to have to even spend a draft pick or Bronny.\"\nThe Lakers seem to be willing to grant James that opportunity. They're open to offering a deal, including the max offer, to bring James back and drafting his son, The Athletic reported. After James had another All-Star season averaging 25.7 points per game, Bayless believes that James has \"earned that right\" to receive a max contract offer and for the Lakers to give him the opportunity to play with his son.\u00a0\n\"He's earned that money because he's not only the face of this franchise, but he's still the face of this league,\" Bayless said. \"Did you see any drop-off in his game? I saw none. Can he lift like he used to? No, he can't. But is he at least as effective as he used to be? Sure, he is. Do you think he can do it again next year or there's a danger that he'll hit the wall next year? I don't think so. He's too smart about what to do in the offseason with his body.\"\nIf those shoes drop for the Lakers, Pierce has an ideal trade target for them this offseason.\n\"Donovan Mitchell would be the perfect fit,\" Pierce said. \"He's not looking for an extension with Cleveland. With the way this series is going against Orlando and they lose in the first round, they'll trade him because he's not going to sign an extension. \u00a0\n\"Now, you have a young Donovan Mitchell you can play with Anthony Davis, who needs to be a No. 2. He's clearly a No. 2 on a championship team. Mitchell would take so much pressure off of LeBron if you give him three years. Now, you're window is back open.\"\n", "description": "LeBron James' future is in question entering the 2024 offseason.

It's understandable that his gaze was not pointed towards future endeavors.\nBut that's not stopping the basketball world from pondering what's next for James. \"First Things First's\" Nick Wright had some ideas for a new destination that he felt would benefit James from both a basketball perspective, and a legacy one: the New York Knicks.\n\"From a trade perspective, a basketball fit perspective \u2026 and it is the best storyline perspective, the New York Knicks,\" Wright said Tuesday on the show. \"That team has not won a championship in 51 years, they have not been to the Finals in 25 years. They have a legitimately excellent team right now that I think \u2013- with respect to the Knicks and what they're building \u2013 is not quite championship caliber right now. \u2026 They have the assets, I think they have a need a power forward right now because I don't trust Julius Randle come the postseason. \u2026 For the first time, the Knicks are, basketball-wise an attractive option for anybody.\"\nFor Wright, James' ability to impact winning at a championship level is not up for debate.\n\"There's no question,\" Wright said, \"LeBron does not impact winning as much as younger LeBron, or peak LeBron. But let's ask it in a different way. How many guys in the league right now impact winning more than LeBron James? \u2026 What do I want LeBron to do next? I'd like him to come to the Knicks. Yes that's a little selfish cause I live here. It also would be an unbelievable final act. \u2026 That's where he could win a championship, he would help get them over the top, it's an iconic franchise, and it would truly add to his legend.\"\nBut Wright was not completely one-track minded in his thinking. He laid out other viable options for James if he decides to depart from L.A.\n\"The Sixers,\" he said, \"who have a ton of cap space, make sense. The Cavs are an interesting one, they could make sense. But what do I think is gonna happen? I think he's gonna stay with the Lakers. I think he's going to leverage his spot with the Lakers to get them to draft Bronny in the second round, to get a three-year full max with a no-trade clause, and see if they can make a few moves, and he can stay at this level, and they can be back in it again.\"\nAnd in case James needed any extra incentivization to join New York, Wright asserted that it'd help his standing in the GOAT debate.\n\"By they way, [you could] get all those Knicks fans that never liked Jordan to begin with on your side in the GOAT debate. That's like an electoral college thing, it's like flipping Texas.

There wasn't enough time for the Magic, who got a 3-pointer in the final second from Banchero, giving him 39 points.\nPlaying in just his fifth postseason game, the 21-year-old Banchero looked like a savvy veteran. He scored 16 points in the fourth and finished 14 of 24 from the field (4 of 7 on 3s) and added eight rebounds.\nMissing starting center Jarrett Allen with a bruised rib, Cleveland got a big lift from Max Strus, who scored 16 in his best game in the back-and-forth series.

Orlando went 29-12 in the regular season at home and are coming off decisive wins at Kia Center.\nMitchell, who has been slowed by a left knee injury, scored 14 in the fourth \u2014 going 9 of 10 at the line.\nWith Banchero leading the way, the Magic, who trailed 2-0 before twice winning big at home, stared down the Cavs and a hostile, towel-waving Cleveland crowd and were poised to pull off their first playoff road win since 2019 at Toronto.\nBut Mitchell, Garland and Mobley wouldn't be denied and the Cavs, who are 16-0 when leading 2-0 in a series, took care of business at home for the third time.\nThe Cavaliers were short-handed as Allen, who has arguably been their best player in this back-and-forth series, sat out with what the team said was a bruised rib.\nAllen, who is averaging 17.0 points and 13.8 rebounds, took an elbow to the ribs in the second half of Game 4 on Saturday. He practiced Monday but was added to the injury report before being ruled out.\nWith Allen out, coach J.B. Bickerstaff went with a smaller first five and started Isaac Okoro.\nBickerstaff has been criticized for a lack of adjustments. But he also went deeper into his bench right away, bringing in guard Sam Merrill and both Tristan Thompson and Morris, who had only played garbage time in the Orlando blowouts.\nGarland played with more aggression and erupted for 17 points in the first quarter \u2014 more than he scored in any game in the series. He made two 3-pointers and Caris LeVert added another as the Cavs scored nine points in the final 1:04 to take a 10-point lead after one.\nBut the Magic outscored the Cavs 24-15 in the second quarter to pull within one at half.\nReporting by The Associated Press.\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

But even with the success \u2014 64 wins this year, the league's No. 1 overall seed, and a second trip to the NBA Finals \u2014 they have had to combat speculation that there wasn't room in the locker room for both of them.\nAlthough Tatum's career numbers have been better, Brown is the highest-paid player in the league \u2014 a quirk of timing and age that gave him the first shot at a supermax contract extension that will earn him more than $300 million over five years. Brown also outplayed Tatum in the 2022 NBA Finals, was the MVP of this year's conference finals and outscored Tatum 22-16 in the Game 1 victory over Dallas on Thursday night.\nThat may explain why Kidd said on Saturday \u2014 twice \u2014 that Brown was Boston's main threat.\n\"Jaylen's their best player,\" the Mavericks coach said. \"He did everything, and that's what your best player does. Just understanding how to play both sides \u2014 defense and offense at a high rate \u2014 he's been doing that the whole playoffs.\"\nBut no one else seems to think so.\nTatum averaged 27 points, eight rebounds and five assists this season, and Brown averaged 23, 5.5 and 3.6. And even with Brown outscoring him in Game 1, Tatum's numbers are also better in the playoffs so far. (And besides: The real star of the opener was Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis.)\nCeltics coach Joe Mazzulla said he's not worried about internal rivalries getting in his team's way, as long as his players \"focus on the truth.\"\n\"What goes on in our locker room, how we communicate with each other, how we build relationships with each other and how we treat each other on and off the floor, that's the most important thing,\" he said.\nThe Mavericks have their own Big Two, with five-time All-NBA first-team guard Luka Doncic teaming up with Kyrie Irving to form an All-Star backcourt. Irving, who teamed with LeBron James to win the 2016 NBA championship in Cleveland even as they struggled to co-exist, said he tries not to pay attention to talk pitting him against his teammate.\n\"I'm just here to play basketball,\" Irving said. \"You've got to be selfless in your approach. Obviously, you're not going to get it right all the time, but as a teammate, you just want to push those other things to the side that don't really matter or get you better as a team.
