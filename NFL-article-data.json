He insisted he had a plan.\nIt just wasn't a very good plan.\nHis strategy for reviving the Dallas running game neared completion on Monday when old friend Ezekiel Elliott agreed to terms on a one-year deal to officially re-sign with the Cowboys. And it's a great story, really, because Elliott is a fan favorite, was once a great player in Dallas, and he'll surely be welcomed by his once-and-former teammates in the locker room. He's also a remarkable athlete who has 11,553 total yards in his eight-year NFL career.\nBut he's also about to turn 29 years old and has shown quite a decline over the last two seasons, while playing a position that when the fall comes, it usually comes fast. And Jones chose him after waving off one of the best free-agent running back classes ever \u2014 a market that included Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry, Josh Jacobs, Aaron Jones, D'Andre Swift, Joe Mixon and Austin Ekeler. There was even a strong Plan B list that included Zach Moss, Gus Edwards and Devin Singletary. And there was the NFL Draft.\nThe Cowboys could have even re-signed Tony Pollard, who got a three-year, $21.75 million contract from the Tennessee Titans. But if they were intent on replacing him after his disappointing 1,005-yard season last year, there were far better options than signing a player who is much closer to being in the Cowboys Ring of Honor than he is to his prime.\nThere is, after all, a really good reason why running backs have been devalued all across the NFL over the last decade or so. They tend to age quickly because of the pounding they take. They get hurt a little more often. They tend to slow down just as players at other positions are speeding into their prime. It's why, for the most part, teams prefer to spend money on their offensive line and plug in someone with young, healthy legs to run the ball behind it.\nElliott has run the ball 2,065 times and caught 356 passes in his eight seasons, which means he's taken about 2,300 hits, not to mention all the collisions from when he was blocking. There is no doubt that pounding has taken its toll.\nIn fact, that's a big reason why the Cowboys cut him last May, rather than pay him the $10.4 million salary he was due, coming off a season in which he ran for just 876 yards (albeit with 12 touchdowns) as part of a backfield timeshare. The Cowboys decided Pollard, then still recovering from a broken leg and badly sprained ankle, was a better investment \u2014 in part because he's three years younger.\u00a0\nSo Elliott signed with the New England Patriots, where his decline continued. He ran the ball 184 times, but only for 642 yards and 3.5 yards per carry \u2014 both career lows, eclipsing the lows he set the year before. It seemed pretty clear then to everyone that he was going to finish his career as a part-time running back, if he continued playing at all.\nBut Jones apparently saw gold in the way Elliott finished. \"I thought he played well the last part of the season at New England,\" he said. \"Very well.\" It takes some rose-colored glasses to see that, though. Elliott started the last five games for the Patriots, rushing 72 times for 213 yards (2.95 per carry). He also caught 27 passes for 159 yards.\nFinancially, at least, Elliott is low-risk. His one-year deal only includes a reported $2 million guaranteed. And if adding a low-risk complementary piece to the backfield was Jones' master plan it would've been fine. No doubt they could use the help, especially in their short-yardage running game.\nBut it sure doesn't look like Elliott is just a complementary piece in a backfield that is currently highlighted by Rico Dawdle (89 carries, 361 yards and two touchdowns last season), Deuce Vaughn (23-40-0), and journeyman Royce Freeman (77-319-2). Even if they go with a running back committee \u2014 as they are expected to do \u2014 Elliott will almost certainly take the lead.\nIt's as if they were waiting for Elliott all along to fill that role. They didn't even take a running back in the draft when everyone assumed they had to. The closest they came was when, after Round 1 was over, Jones told the world how much he loved Texas running back Jonathon Brooks, who might have been their second-round pick if the Carolina Panthers didn't beat them to it 10 picks earlier.\nJones dismissed any concern by saying \"I've seen teams win the Super Bowl with running backs that they traded for midseason.\" That, of course, is much more of a hope than a plan, too. It counts on a team with a strong, healthy running back, probably on an expiring contract, deciding they're out of playoff contention by October. It also counts on the Cowboys being the highest bidder \u2014 something they rarely seem to be.\nMaybe that miracle happens. But the real miracle they need now is a revival of Elliott, because for the moment he really is the Cowboys' only hope. They may need him to be close to the player he was in 2021, his last 1,000-yard season (1,002 yards, 10 touchdowns), when he averaged 4.2 yards per carry. Because the running game was a huge Achilles heel for them last season. They relied far too much on Dak Prescott's arm and CeeDee Lamb's playmaking ability. They couldn't run effectively or explosively. Their short-yardage and goal-line running game was weak.\nThey simply couldn't lean on their rushing attack in big spots where they needed it, which is why later in the season they sometimes didn't even try.\nMaybe Elliott is the cavalry. Jones certainly thinks so. He even said \"He's good enough to be a starter,\" which he now almost certainly is.\nBut the Cowboys can only hope that's the case. And hope is not a strategy, and the past is not the future. Elliott's homecoming might make for a warm and fuzzy moment and bring back some wonderful memories. But the \"all in\" Cowboys needed something more helpful than that.\nRalph Vacchiano is the NFC East reporter for FOX Sports, covering the Washington Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants.

For Morgan and first-year coach Dave Canales, they've upgraded the cast around quarterback Bryce Young enough to at least evaluate him fairly in 2024.\n\"Specifically talking about the offense ... with a running back, a receiver and a tight end, skill-wise, just bringing a little juice there to really challenge that whole group and elevate that offense,\" Canales said Saturday. \"I'm really excited about what we did there. ... [Young] is very fired up about what we've put together.\"\nThe weekend started with Chicago using a pick acquired from Carolina to take USC quarterback Caleb Williams, taking the spotlight a year after the Panthers had that in drafting Young first. That trade and that pick were part of a difficult 2023 season that saw an 0-6 start, the firing of a head coach and general manager and the worst record in the league.\nEven without that top pick, Carolina got back into the first round, trading up a spot to No. 32 to get South Carolina receiver Xavier Legette, then traded up again to No. 46 to get Texas' Jonathon Brooks as the first running back taken. Brooks is recovering from a torn ACL but is expecting to be healthy for the start of training camp and will upgrade a Panthers run game that averaged fewer than 4 yards a carry for the first time since 2006.\n\"Versatility, first and foremost,\" Canales said of what he likes about Brooks. \"There's so much that he brings. Vision, patience, contact balance, acceleration. He's got it all. He's the best back in this class, and we were so fired up to be able to bring him in.\"\nAdd in Longhorns tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders with the first pick of the fourth round \u2014 more than 600 receiving yards in each of the last two seasons \u2014 and it's three new weapons to upgrade an offense that sorely lacked a big-play threat last season.\nIf the priority in free agency was improving the line protecting Young \u2014 investing $153 million in guards Robert Hunt and Damien Lewis \u2014 then the offensive focus in the draft shifted to the skill positions. Some had expected the Panthers to draft a center, but they're confident in Austin Corbett, who has 62 career starts at guard but is shifting inside and handling the transition well.\nCarolina used four of its last five draft picks on defense, and the prospect with the best shot at starting is Kentucky linebacker Trevin Wallace, a third-round pick who should challenge veteran Shaq Thompson as he returns from a season-ending ankle injury. Wallace, 21, had one of the fastest 40 times of any linebacker in the draft at 4.51 seconds with a 37-inch vertical as well.\n\"An athletic freak, a guy who can run sideline to sideline, strike ball carriers,\" Morgan said Friday after selecting Wallace. \"His ceiling is really high. I think he's a guy who's going to develop, keep developing and turn into a good linebacker for us.\"\n[RELATED: 2024 NFL Draft grades: Analyzing all 32 teams' classes; Who gets top marks?]\nMuch of the Panthers' retooling came in free agency, with potentially six new starters arriving there: edge rushers Jadeveon Clowney and D.J. Wonnum, defensive tackle A'Shawn Robinson, linebacker Josey Jowell, safety Jordan Fuller and corner Dane Jackson. Some had expected Carolina to address the pass rush after trading Pro Bowler Brian Burns to the Giants, but Clowney and Wonnum will take much of that responsibility.\nCanales, known for his relentless enthusiasm and positivity, was almost too excited about prospects entering the draft. When Legette made it known before the draft that Canales had told him the Panthers would take him if he was available at 33, Canales downplayed the praise by saying he'd said that to him \"and 50 other guys.\" Carolina liked Legette enough to trade up a single spot, correctly getting ahead of a run on receivers early in the second round, and Canales was again unabashed in his praise.\n\"We loved him. I'm not going to sit here and lie about that,\" Canales said. \"I meant what I said. There were a lot of guys we were excited about in that area at 33. ... To get the guy that we love, for us, this whole process has been let's get guys who are not just great football players, but guys that really are us, are Panthers.\"\nCarolina has a focus on the future, and in a draft with so few underclassmen, they took three \u2014 Wallace turned 21 in February, Sanders did in March and Brooks won't turn 21 until July. The Panthers also recouped the 2025 second-round pick they'd given up in the original trade for Young, trading down in the second round to add the future pick before trading back up for Brooks. Most of the offseason overhaul is complete, and now the team can look forward to forging a new identity in training camp and the season ahead.\n\"Me and Dave, we talk every day about the roster and which ways we can make it better,\" Morgan said. \"I think we're headed in a good direction.\"\nGreg Auman is FOX Sports' NFC South reporter, covering the Buccaneers, Falcons, Panthers and Saints.

Evaluate how they fit in with the organization, especially for a quarterback.\n\"To me, the age, they're going to be more, especially with a guy like Bo Nix, 61 starts, we feel like he'll be more game-ready than if we were going to draft a 21-year-old.\"\nAs Paton alluded to, Nix's 61 starts were the most ever for an FBS quarterback, starting three years at Auburn before transferring to Oregon in 2022.\nThat sort of experience might be needed for a Broncos squad that went 8-9 last season in Sean Payton's first year as head coach. With Denver looking to make the postseason in Year 2 of Payton's tenure, the only other quarterbacks the Broncos had on their roster entering the draft were Jarrett Stidham, Ben Dinucci and newly acquired Zach Wilson, after they released Russell Wilson at the onset of the offseason.\u00a0\nPayton wasn't shy in stating his interest in drafting a quarterback with his first-round pick in the lead-up to the draft, even suggesting to reporters at one point that they could trade up to select one. They hosted Michael Penix Jr. on a visit in April and held a private workout with J.J. McCarthy after his Pro Day in March.\nBut Nix's private workout in front of Payton and other staffers at Oregon on March 19 sealed the deal on whom the Broncos wanted the most, according to Paton.\n\"I'd watched all the quarterbacks, seen them live (during the regular season on scouting trips),\" Paton said. \"And then the season's over, I get with Sean and we watched the quarterbacks (on tape). And Sean liked a lot of these quarterbacks.\n\"And when we got to Bo it was pretty instant. Sean was like, \u2018man.' You know, Sean.\n\"He really liked him, and then we went to the private workout and spent three hours with Bo in the meeting setting, and he was outstanding. And we go out to the field, and he made 10, 15 throws and Sean came up to me and said, \u2018This is the guy.'\n\"And I said, \u2018Hey, we've got a whole process to go through. But he was really the target from then on.\"\nNix was widely viewed as the sixth-best quarterback in the 2024 draft class, with FOX Sports NFL Draft expert Rob Rang and lead college football analyst Joel Klatt ranking him in that spot. But Klatt also had the Broncos selecting Nix with the 12th pick in all of his mock drafts, believing he's the right fit for Payton's offense due to his accuracy and ability to get the ball out quickly.\nNix had also ascended at Oregon over the last couple of seasons. He was statistically one of the best quarterbacks in the nation in 2023, throwing for 4,508 yards, 45 touchdowns and three interceptions, plus six rushing scores, helping the Ducks go 11-2.\nTo help Nix transition into the NFL, the Broncos added his top pass-catcher from last season, Troy Franklin. The Broncos traded up to the No. 101 overall pick to snag the wide receiver, who had 81 receptions for 1,383 yards and 14 touchdowns last season.\u00a0\nNow, Nix and Franklin hope to help turn around the Broncos, just as they helped Oregon over the last two seasons.\nExiting the draft, at FanDuel Sportsbook, Nix is at +2800 to win Offensive Rookie of the Year. The Over/Under for his regular-season passing yards is set at 2850.5.\u00a0\nThe Broncos are at -950 to miss the playoffs and +590 to make it. Their Over/Under win total is set at 5.5, and they have the longest odds to win the AFC West at +2000.\nFollow along with FOX Sports for the latest news on the NFL and other sports.\n", "description": "Broncos GM George Paton thinks Bo Nix's relative old age for a prospect is a benefit, believing he's more likely to make an instant impact.", "hero_img": "https://statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Bo-Nix.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/128/72/Bo-Nix.jpg", "category": "NFL", "date": "Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:33:53 -0400", "comments": []}, {"title": "Christian Barmore's mega contract is about Patriots winning back players", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/christian-barmores-mega-contract-is-about-patriots-winning-back-players", "content": "Trust us.\nThat seems to be the message to the players from the New England Patriots' new leadership group this offseason.\nThe Patriots have made a major effort to keep their budding stars happy despite a 4-13 season in 2023. They've gone the no-nonsense route of paying them big sums of money. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore is the latest example. On Monday, the Patriots signed Barmore, a 2021 second-round pick, to a massive four-year extension worth up to $92 million.\nThere's a shift happening. Bill Belichick rarely extended players to second contracts, which are generally the most lucrative deal of a player's career. But with Belichick now gone, New England has spent the offseason investing in its own standouts: Michael Onwenu, Kyle Dugger and now Barmore.\nPatriots first-year coach Jerod Mayo joked in January that the team was going to \"burn some cash.\" And, though he backtracked on those comments, he eventually kept his promise.\nThose three players signed deals worth $207 million in new money.\nFollowing Belichick's departure, Mayo and executive Eliot Wolf have been working to earn back the trust that Belichick lost. All this money is an effort to show the Patriots' locker room that, while players didn't always get paid in the previous regime, they will get paid in this one. If they play hard and play well, they won't be shown the door in free agency. They'll get their payday from the Patriots.\nFor a team that's no longer a winner, that kind of message can help boost morale.\nThere are surely other initiatives taking place beyond these financial ones. Mayo was once a player, and he is a master of building relationships.\u00a0\nNew England has also gone out of its way to patch up relationships that Belichick damaged with the media. The team scheduled an off-the-record session for media members and the entire coaching staff. While the media and the team didn't have the happiest relationship in the previous regime, the session was geared at resetting the tense situation and building relationships. If things like that are happening with out-of-house reporters, you can bet they're happening within the coaching staff and the locker room.\nAnd things got bad in the locker room last year. Belichick's tough coaching style and atypical decision-making once made him a trendsetter. But as the team lost more and more, his evil-genius routine lost its appeal. Mayo and Wolf have not totally abandoned Belichick's ideology. But it's also clear they're not afraid to throw out the bathwater.\nWolf made it pretty clear from the get-go that he wanted to draft, develop and \u2014 most important \u2014 retain players. And there were plenty of well-drafted and well-developed players on this roster.\nNow this is all well and good. It sounds lovely. But there is a reason why Belichick has long avoided the second contract: the overspending. He was, for two decades, a master of replacing departing players with acquisitions who cost less.\nDid the Patriots overpay for these three players?\u00a0\nThe Patriots made Dugger the sixth-highest-paid safety in the NFL, according to average annual value. New England made Onwenu the fifth-highest-paid right tackle, per AAV. And if his AAV lands at $23.5 million, as the initial contract numbers indicate, the Patriots tied Barmore for seventh in the league among interior defensive linemen.\nYes, these were overpays.\nOverspending is often how bad teams keep good players.\nDoes everyone want to play for the Chiefs right now? Yes. Just like they wanted to play for the Patriots during the peak of their dynasty. But the Chiefs \u2014 just like every other NFL team \u2014 are often looking for team-friendly deals.\u00a0\nThe key to spending is ensuring there's a safe return on investment. New England is taking a big risk on this unit. Barmore might just be the biggest risk of all, with his deal eclipsing a financial commitment larger than any Patriots player not named Tom Brady.\u00a0\nBarmore had a great 2023 season with 8.5 sacks and 64 tackles on 66% of snaps. He finished with 49 pressures and 40 stops, and he demonstrated the ability to play at multiple positions on the defensive line, per Pro Football Focus. While he predominantly played as a defensive tackle in his first two seasons, he played a much higher clip at both nose tackle and edge in 2023.\u00a0\nBut that was just one year. The Patriots are paying him as if they expect him to produce like that every year. It remains to be seen whether he can maintain the quality of play from that impressive season.\nThis signing is as much about the 2024 draft class as it is about Barmore. Wolf is telling his current locker room: Trust us. And he's saying the same thing to the incoming players. Because the Patriots are looking to the rookies to serve as foundational players in this rebuild.\nCertainly, New England didn't get better on paper through free agency. The organization didn't make any major splash signings (though it tried with receiver Calvin Ridley, who ultimately signed with Tennessee). The offseason has been more about not losing key players than it has been about acquiring bona fide stars.\nThe Patriots used the draft to restock at positions where they've missed in recent years. Quarterback Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick, is set to replace Mac Jones. Receivers Ja'Lynn Polk, a second-rounder, and Javon Baker, a fourth-rounder, should take on more substantial roles than Tyquan Thornton and JuJu Smith-Schuster had. Tackle Caedan Wallace, a third-rounder, is a developmental tackle whom the Patriots hope will someday replace Trent Brown. Fourth-round guard Layden Robinson seems like insurance if former first-round pick Cole Strange continues to play poorly.\n[READ MORE: 2024 NFL Draft grades: Analyzing all 32 teams' classes; Who gets top marks?]\nThis draft felt like the foundation of a full reboot. These contract extensions are just the same. That's the plan, at least.

Zinter was picked in the third round, No. 85 overall, following a standout four-year career in Ann Arbor where he was a three-year starter, two-time All-Big Ten selection (2022, 2023) and a unanimous All-American (2023).\nBut there is another layer to the connection between Hall and Zinter. During Michigan's 30-24 win over Ohio State in last year's rivalry game, Hall was the player who was blocked into Zinter's leg, which led to a gruesome injury, causing him to break his tibia and fibula. The injury ended Zinter's senior season and collegiate career at Michigan, but the former Wolverine made it clear there were no hard feelings between him and his new NFL teammate.\n\"Being my rival throughout my career and finally being teammates here, it's crazy,\" Zinter said in an interview with ESPN. \"I'm going to be seeing him day in and day out. But we're brothers now, and it's all about that.\"\nFOX Sports' Joel Klatt was on the call for the Michigan-Ohio State game and described the emotional scene at the Big House when Zinter went down and how the Wolverines' fan base united to beat their rivals.\nZinter is expected to make a full recovery from the injury and will join Hall at the Browns' rookie minicamp, which will take place May 10-12.\n\"I'm good for everything,\" Zinter said in an interview with Cleveland.com. \"I've just been building the strength back and getting moving again. But I'm feeling great. I'm ready to roll.\"\nBoth Zinter and Hall are expected to add depth on the interior of Cleveland's offensive and defensive lines, but neither are expected to start in their first season.\u00a0\n\"I think Michael Hall and Zak Zinter are good players who bolster the offensive and defensive lines, but that doesn't move the needle much for 2024,\" FOX Sports NFL analyst David Helman said. \"This is a vet-heavy team that won't lean much on rookies, from the looks of it.\"\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Los Angeles ChargersSuper Bowl odds: +5000\nCowherd's thoughts: \"Justin Herbert and Jim Harbaugh are great, but they lost a lot of offense \u2014 Austin Ekeler, Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Gerald Everett. They lost productive, veteran dudes. I like [Ladd McConkey], I like Joe Alt \u2014 both good picks. They got Hayden Hurst, they got J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, but I don't think they're going to be quite as lethal offensively. But I love the coach, I love the quarterback, and I love their offensive tackles.\"\n9. Houston TexansSuper Bowl odds: +1600\nCowherd's thoughts: \"I may be wrong. They may be higher than this. I just love the way they're run. I liked their draft. I liked their free agent moves \u2014 Stefon Diggs, Danielle Hunter, Joe Mixon. The last two years in personnel, they've done as well as anybody in this league. \u2026 I like the way they're coached, their quarterback, their front office.\"\n8. Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0Super Bowl odds: +1400\nCowherd's thoughts: \"Offensively, the team's stacked, with or without Jason Kelce. They have star receivers, a star tight end, and now Saquon Barkley as a star running back around Jalen Hurts. They have new coordinators, and I just want to watch that unfold. A couple of years ago, I loved their coordinators. Last year, I didn't like their coordinators. Let's see where they land this year.\"\n7. Buffalo BillsSuper Bowl odds: +1300\nCowherd's thoughts: \"I'm not having Josh Allen out of my top 10. I thought they had another excellent draft. Stefon Diggs was done there. Oh, they lost Gabe Davis \u2014 you never knew what you were getting with Gabe Davis. And they went out and drafted Keon Coleman. If we're going to give Kansas City credit for their star receiver in the draft, why can't I give Buffalo credit for theirs? I have the Bills still hovering around the Super Bowl bubble.\"\n6. San Francisco 49ersSuper Bowl odds: +550\nCowherd's thoughts: \"They get Talanoa Hufanga back at safety, and they did address some secondary stuff this offseason. They had nine Pro Bowlers that all return from last year, and they went and drafted two receivers, including Ricky Pearsall in the first round. They're probably gonna move off Deebo Samuel. But \u2014 and I've said this \u2014 I think they peaked last year. I thought that was the best of them.\"\n5. Green Bay PackersSuper Bowl odds: +1900\nCowherd's thoughts: \"I love the Packers. I don't think they quite have the roster of Detroit, but I love them. Josh Jacobs is maybe the best or second-best running back in the league. They allowed the third-fewest sacks in the league. This team drafts as well as anybody. \u2026 The Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the best first four picks of anybody in the draft.\"\n4. Los Angeles RamsSuper Bowl odds: +3200\nCowherd's thoughts: \"I thought they had an unbelievable first four picks. Four guys who will start \u2014 Blake Corum won't start, but he'll play a ton behind Kyren Williams. All my executive buddies in this league scouts thought the Rams crushed it, and they crushed last year's draft, too. They lost Aaron Donald, but they went and literally got the two players they targeted. Jared Verse is the guy. \u2026 I think if Matthew Stafford is healthy, this team is going to be excellent.\"\n3. Detroit LionsSuper Bowl odds: +1300\nCowherd's thoughts: \"I think they have a stacked roster. I think they're the Niners, but with younger players and a more talented quarterback. They were No. 3 in total offense, No. 2 in passing offense. They can play from behind. They can play with the lead. They got to the conference championship for the first time since 1991. \u2026 Their big issue last year, like Philadelphia, was that they were getting torched at cornerback. They addressed both cornerback spots.\"\n2. Baltimore RavensSuper Bowl odds: +950\nCowherd's thoughts: \"They were the best team for most of the regular season. Why wouldn't I like them? They went and got Derrick Henry. They had a disappointing postseason, but they rolled teams in the regular season last year. There's no reason not to like them. Lamar Jackson is in his prime and the coaching staff is great.\"\n1. Kansas City ChiefsSuper Bowl odds: +600\nCowherd's thoughts: \"They're at the top until somebody knocks them off. Travis Kelce and Chris Jones signed extensions. Xavier Worthy, I don't know how good he'll be \u2014 he worries me with his small size as a track guy \u2014 but if anybody's going to make it work, it'll be Kansas City. They added Hollywood Brown. If Rashee Rice returns, I think their receiving core will be much more worthy of acclaim than it was last year, and last year was the year to beat them.\"\nFollow along with FOX Sports for the latest news on the NFL and other sports.\n", "description": "Colin Cowherd is not as high on the defending NFC champions after the draft.

Alt is now tasked with helping keep star quarterback Justin Herbert upright, while representing the first draft pick of the Jim Harbaugh era.\nWhat are Alt's early impressions of his new head coach?\nOn Tuesday's edition of \"The Herd,\" Alt explained to Colin Cowherd what he loves about Harbaugh.\n\"I think Coach Harbaugh's a great coach,\" Alt said. \"The biggest thing for me is he wanted me. He wanted offensive linemen, and he has an appreciation for offensive linemen. It makes me, as a player, want to work that much harder for a coach like that and try to succeed. I've spoken with him since I've been chosen every day, and I'm really excited to get started there.\"\nHarbaugh was previously the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, with whom he won last season's College Football Playoff National Championship.\u00a0\nOn that note, three of the 13 Wolverines players who were selected in the 2024 draft were offensive linemen: Zak Zinter, Trevor Keegan and LaDarius Henderson. Michigan built a reputation over the past three seasons for being a team that imposed its will up front through the running game. Furthermore, the Chargers selected two Michigan players of their own, linebacker Junior Colson (No. 69) and wide receiver Cornelius Johnson (No. 253).\nAlt, who stands at 6-foot-8 and 322 pounds, was Notre Dame's primary left tackle across his three seasons in South Bend. He was a two-time All-American who will likely play right tackle for the Chargers, as former first-round draft pick and Pro Bowler Rashawn Slater is their starting left tackle.\nWhile expressing that he'll play whichever tackle spot the Chargers want, Alt detailed where he wants to improve in the NFL.\n\"The pass, I always want to improve my strike. I think being able to strike a defensive end and kind of take the fight to them throws them out of their rush pattern, their rush plan, so I think that's a huge thing being able to really be dominant with that,\" Alt said. \"And the run game, just always trying to be lower. I have, obviously, a large frame, but when I'm able to get underneath guys and use that frame and that leverage to explode through guys, it really is a helpful thing, so just always trying to play lower in everything I do in the run game.\"\nThe Chargers are coming off a 5-12 season.\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Moore as well as running back D'Andre Swift and tight end Gerald Everett.\nMoore arrived in Chicago last offseason when the Bears traded the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft to the Carolina Panthers in a deal that also included the Panthers' top 2024 pick \u2014 which eventually turned into Williams after the Panthers finished a league-worst 2-15. He quickly formed chemistry with then-quarterback Justin Fields, helping the former Ohio State signal-caller to the best season of his career, but it still was not enough to prevent Fields from getting dealt to the Pittsburgh Steelers in March to clear the runway for Williams.\nStill, Moore was quick to praise Williams when asked about the former USC quarterback in a recent interview with The Daily Mirror U.S.\n\"The anticipation is there,\" Moore said. \"You can tell that he's expecting us to be open at a certain time, so that's going to be one of the things that's better. But just gotta be on the same page with him going forward and it's just going to take some time. Maybe it'll be fast, or maybe it'll take so time. I'm hoping it's fast.\"\nMoore will not just have to adjust to a new quarterback, but a new role. After being the Bears' clear No. 1 receiver last season, he now figures to see more time as a slot receiver and sharing targets with Allen, a six-time Pro Bowler with the \u00a0Chargers. Poles also drafted former standout Washington receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 overall pick, eight spots after taking Williams, in last week's draft, and the Bears also have another solid pass-catching option in incumbent tight end Cole Kmet, who was drafted before Poles' arrival.\nBut the trade-off might be worth it, as Moore has a chance to be part of one of the most exciting collections of talent ever assembled in a Chicago franchise that has historically struggled in that area, with its best years (including its 1985 Super Bowl win) coming with the Bears' defense as their calling card. In today's NFL, however, Poles and the Bears appear to be building an offense that can compete with their NFC North rivals Green Bay Packers, Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings, all of whom have made the playoffs over the past two seasons thanks to stellar quarterback play.\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Ridley last season was the Jags' leading pass-catcher with 1,016 receiving yards and their only top wideout to play 17 games. The No. 23 overall pick, Thomas is tasked with not only filling Ridley's void, but also helping to bring the best out of quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who had a disappointing 2023 season.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne way Thomas figures to do that is with his speed.\u00a0\nHe ran an official 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine, second-fastest among wide receivers. And his acceleration is even more eye-popping. His 1.78-second \"flying 20\" was the fastest among all players at the combine. He also had the second-highest athletic score among all players at his position at the event.\u00a0\nThomas' ability to get behind defenses was evident at LSU, where he led the FBS with 17 receiving touchdowns in 2023. On throws of 20-plus yards last season, he had 15 receptions on 22 targets for 670 yards and 12 touchdowns, according to Pro Football Focus.\u00a0\n\"Just my ability to use my speed, be able to get open, create space on defenders,\" Thomas said in describing his game. \"I would say that's just a big role in how I play.\"\nIn Ridley's departure, Jacksonville lost its most prolific speedster. His average maximum route speed was 22.11 miles per hour, more than two mph faster than any other skill player on the roster, according to Next Gen Stats. Ridley's average route speed of 14.2 mph was also the highest among the team's skill players who ran at least 50 routes last season.\u00a0\nJacksonville is getting some of that speed back in Thomas.\u00a0\n\"You're adding a skilled receiver,\" coach Doug Pederson said of the rookie. \"You're adding depth. You're adding a guy that has an element of speed that we haven't had probably since Calvin last year. \u2026 I think it can only be a great asset for us on offense to not only open up the field, but I think open up some other elements of the offense.\"\nThat can include the intermediate passing game.\u00a0\nBetween Thomas and Davis, who was sixth in the NFL last season with 16.6 yards per reception, the Jags could have a deep passing game that opens up the middle of the field for tight end Evan Engram and receiver Christian Kirk, who's at his best operating out of the slot.\u00a0\nThere could be opportunities there for Thomas, too.\u00a0\n\"There's going to be some different coverages that he's going to see here at the NFL level. A lot of teams try to keep that at bay, they try not to get receivers behind you,\" Pederson explained. \"But it's our job as coaches to make sure that we create opportunities to do that and utilize that speed.\u00a0\n\"What that does then, is open up the second-level area. That's where those 12-to-15-to-20-to-25-yard ranges are really important. That's where you can spend a lot of time and make a lot of catches in those areas with what we saw on tape, with Brian being able to separate at the top of the route and use that athleticism and use his strength and his size to create some openness there in that second level.\"\nAt LSU, Thomas was half of the FBS' most dynamic wide receiver tandem last season. He got behind some of the SEC's best defenses with ease.\nIt will be more difficult in the NFL, where the defensive backs are smarter, faster, stronger and more physical. The matchups are more even, sometimes tipped in the defense's favor.\u00a0\nThat's the space in which the Jaguars need Thomas to thrive to fill Ridley's void.\n\"It's going to take some time, it's going to take some new learning with a new system,\" Pederson said. \"But I'm very confident. We've got rookie minicamp coming up and then the rest of the offseason program. We're going to do everything we can to get him caught up to speed as fast as we can and get him plugged in.\"\nLawrence's success \u2014 the team's success \u2014 may lean heavily on it.\nBen Arthur is the AFC South reporter for FOX Sports.

Now, Elliott is where he wants to be.\u00a0\n\"This was my priority. Doing what I could do to get back here,\" Elliott told the Star-Telegram on Monday after he reportedly agreed to a deal to sign back with the Cowboys. \"I have a lot left to accomplish here. I'm excited to get back with the fellas and chase that ring.\"\nElliott was released by the Cowboys in 2023 in a cap-clearing move. Dallas nearly saved $11 million by releasing Elliott, who was coming off a season where he rushed for a career-low 876 yards on 3.8 yards per carry at 27. However, he also rushed for 12 touchdowns in 2022.\u00a0\nRumors of a possible reunion between Elliott and the Cowboys lingered shortly after his release from New England in March 2023. Dak Prescott stated on multiple occasions that he'd like to see the team bring back Elliott, who he formed a close bond with as they were drafted together in 2016. Jerry Jones also remained open to the idea throughout the 2023 offseason.\nBut after months of waiting for the next opportunity, Elliott joined the Patriots in the middle of training camp on a one-year deal. While he set new career lows in rushing yards and yards per carry, Elliott was an effective backup to Rhamondre Stevenson. He rushed for 642 yards on 3.5 yards per carry, adding 51 receptions for 313 yards with five total touchdowns as he was a rare spark for a Patriots offense that was arguably the worst in football.\nShortly after New England's season ended, Elliott reemerged in Dallas, attending the Cowboys' playoff loss to the Green Bay Packers. With Tony Pollard leaving in free agency and the Cowboys not doing much to address the position earlier in the offseason, rumors of a reunion between Elliott and Dallas surfaced ahead of the 2024 NFL Draft.\nElliott told the Star-Telegram that he feels like \"I'm still a starter,\" sharing that he's in good health after a PCL injury affected his last season with the Cowboys.\n\"I think I'm good,\" Elliott said. \"My body felt really good last year. My body felt good all of last year. I got my physical. My PCL looks to be healed. So health-wise, I think that I'm definitely better than when I left.\"\nThe Cowboys' running backs room doesn't have many notable names and certainly doesn't have anyone who's ever produced at the level Elliott has had in his career. Elliott will be competing with Rico Dowdle, Royce Freeman, Deuce Vaughn, Malik Davis, Snoop Connor and undrafted rookie Nathaniel Peat for a role on the Cowboys in 2024.\nHowever, Elliott is also focused on winning. He helped usher in a new era of Cowboys football when they selected him with the fourth overall pick in 2016, partnering up with Prescott to help them go 14-2 and win the NFC East as rookies. Elliott emerging as one of the game's best running backs helped the Cowboys remain in playoff contention for much of his first seven years with the team, rushing for over 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns four times.\nBut the Cowboys never got over the hump during Elliott's first tenure. They made it to the postseason four times with Elliott, never advancing past the NFC Divisional Round as they lost in that round three times.\nElliott is hoping his second tenure in Dallas ends differently.\u00a0\n\"From 2016, we've been working on building this franchise to get a chance to win the Super Bowl,\" Elliott said. \"That is obviously the priority. That's the bar.\"\n", "description": "Ezekiel Elliott never wanted to leave the Cowboys, saying in an interview that he was \"doing what I could do to\" return to Dallas.", "hero_img": "https://statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Ezekiel-Elliott.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/128/72/Ezekiel-Elliott.jpg", "category": "NFL", "date": "Tue, 30 Apr 2024 15:21:58 -0400", "comments": []}, {"title": "Detroit Lions OT Penei Sewell: I want the Lombardi Trophy 'now'", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/detroit-lions-ot-penei-sewell-i-want-the-lombardi-trophy-now", "content": "Last season, Penei Sewell and the Detroit Lions fell just short of making the Super Bowl.\nNow, the star offensive tackle has one goal in mind.\n\"We need it all.

How the Chicago Bears now lead with offense", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/how-the-chicago-bears-now-lead-with-offense", "content": "The Chicago Bears are having an identity crisis of the best kind. A team known for its defensive prowess for the past few decades has now had a full-on rom-com makeover. It's now all about the offense, baby.\nWith the addition of Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze with the ninth overall pick in this year's NFL Draft, the Bears could conceivably have the NFL's best wideout room.\u00a0\nAs part of an effort to create the best possible landing spot for newly minted Bears quarterback Caleb Williams, general manager Ryan Poles infused the offense with experience. He traded a fourth-round pick for Keenan Allen after acquiring D.J. Moore in the trade down from the top spot last year. For good measure, Poles then also grabbed Odunze with the team's second first-round pick in 2024, a player with whom Williams already seems to have a rapport.\u00a0\nIn fact, all four of the aforementioned players had a throwing session the week before the draft, before Williams or Odunze were even Bears.\n\"I found out, was it two days ago? That that popped out,\" Poles said on draft night. \"I thought it was pretty cool. Still at that point I was nervous that wasn't going to be able to work out where we would have to do something to make that work out. So when I found that out, it was cool, and obviously now that group has worked together, which is good.\"\nIf you consider that Moore is still this team's top wide receiver, Allen is now their WR2, who should be used primarily in the slot, the speedy Odunze will now stretch the field, adding the complementary dimension to his veteran counterparts.\u00a0\nOdunze was widely considered one of the three best receivers in this draft class. The other two, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Malik Nabers, were drafted to be their team's top option. Odunze is his team's third option and could instantly become the league's best at that spot. Take a second and try to think of anyone you'd take over him right now.\nBecause of that, I don't think there's a receiver trio out there that will end up contending with what Chicago will field this season.\u00a0\nFor a team as generationally starved for offense as Chicago, that's a wild thought.\nMoore was the team's leading receiver last season, amassing 1,364 yards, good for the sixth most in the NFL. According to Next Gen Stats, Moore had the second-most receiving yards over expectation, with a 15.1-yard average. That's second to only CeeDee Lamb and means Moore is one of the best at creating with less. He also had the second-most receptions of 20 yards or more, second only to Tyreek Hill. Meanwhile, Allen was in Los Angeles, taking up 30.5 percent of his team's target share, good for the third-best in the league behind Hill and Davante Adams. That's pretty impressive for a guy that spent 56.7 percent of his time in the slot.\nNow, you're adding Odunze who recorded a 4.45 40-yard dash at the combine to pair with a diverse skillset.\u00a0\n\"As a receiver he can line anywhere... inside, outside,\" Poles said after drafting Odunze. \"You love his ability to finish in contested situations. Plays strong. Plays big. Runs after catches very good. He's a punt returner as well. I mean, the kid has just put time in and gotten better and better every single year, and he's a winner. He can impact the game at any moment. If you are a quarterback and in doubt and you want to go give a guy an opportunity to go finish, he's your guy. He's done that consistently.\"\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. The Miami Dolphins have Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. The Cincinnati Bengals? Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Those are all tandems. The only wide receiver trio of consequence is in Seattle with D.K. Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. But even then, would you take them over what the Bears have? There's a case to be made that Chicago still wins out offensively \u2014 especially if Williams is the Prince Who Was Promised.\nIt's a new era in the Windy City. With that new era, comes a new identity \u2014 one Chicago has never seen before.\u00a0\nEven with a defensive head coach in Matt Eberflus. Even with a top-five defense. This is now an offensive team and the first of its kind in the blue and orange. That in and of itself should be enough to tell Bears fans, this time it really could be different.\nCarmen Vitali covers the NFC North for FOX Sports.

Of course, we'll see some veteran additions in the lead-up to Week 1, but we now have a clear picture of what every team in the league has to offer.\nWhat does that mean? That it's time for a new set of power rankings, obviously. With the rookies all settling into their new cities, this is how the big picture looks across the league. Each entry includes an indication of how the team has fared since our most recent rankings, which came right after the Super Bowl.\nNFL Power Rankings\u00a0\n1. Kansas City Chiefs (no change)\nPretty easy call to keep the reigning champs right where they left off. The Chiefs pulled off a repeat with the least-explosive offense of the Patrick Mahomes Era, but they've fixed that issue. We'll see how Rashee Rice's legal situation pans out, but the additions of Hollywood Brown and Xavier Worthy should help bring the fireworks back to Kansas City. It hurts to lose L'Jarius Sneed, but retaining Chris Jones helps offset that loss. The Chiefs have a real-deal shot at an unprecedented three-peat.\n2. Philadelphia Eagles (+5)\nClearly, last season's collapse left a sour taste in Howie Roseman's mouth.\u00a0The Eagles general manager has pulled every lever this offseason. The Birds added Saquon Barkley to an already-amazing offense, and they replenished\u00a0the defensive depth chart with signings like Bryce Huff and C.J. Gardner-Johnson, not to mention big-time draft picks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. No excuses in Philly if Jalen Hurts & Co. can't improve on last year's\u00a0lousy finish.\n[READ MORE: 2024 NFL Draft grades: Analyzing all 32 teams' classes; Who gets top marks?]\n3. San Francisco 49ers (-1)\nNiners fans might bristle at getting passed up by the Eagles, but there are\u00a0(small) causes for concern in the Bay. For starters, there's going to be\u00a0speculation about Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel's futures for the rest of the offseason. On top of that, the defense is without two underrated pieces:\u00a0Arik Armstead was released at the start of the league year, and Dre\u00a0Greenlaw is still recovering from his Achilles tear in the Super Bowl. The\u00a049ers are clearly still contenders, but these are issues worth worrying about.\n4. Detroit Lions (-1)\nThe Lions return almost the exact same offense that lit up the league last\u00a0season, complete with major extensions for Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei\u00a0Sewell. The defense looks vastly upgraded, with D.J. Reader manning the\u00a0middle of the defensive line and three new corners in the secondary. On\u00a0paper, the Lions look better than the team that fell oh-so short of the Super\u00a0Bowl, and they should be eager to prove it.\n5. Houston Texans (+6)\nI was worried about how well the Texans would replace all their free agent\u00a0losses, but I guess I shouldn't have been. Houston stockpiled its defense\u00a0with free-agent signings, and on offense the trades for Stefon Diggs and Joe\u00a0Mixon should help C.J. Stroud take things up a notch. It's going to be fun to\u00a0see if the Texans can truly ascend into the league's elite.\n6. Green Bay Packers (-2)\nSo much of the Packers' success will hinge on Jordan Love and all of his\u00a0young pass-catchers continuing to ascend. But adding Josh Jacobs and Xavier McKinney to a team that finished 2023 on a red-hot run looks awfully\u00a0appealing. It would also be great if new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley can\u00a0coax more production out of that defense.\n7. Baltimore Ravens (-2)\nThe Ravens' biggest win of the offseason was locking down Justin Madubuike\u00a0on a major contract extension. Adding a true, difference-making running\u00a0back in Derrick Henry doesn't hurt, either. I still worry that this is a team that lost a lot \u2014 from the roster and the coaching staff \u2014 and might struggle to\u00a0replace it.\n8. Cincinnati Bengals (+5)\nThe Bengals will be better in 2024 for no other reason than having a healthy\u00a0Joe Burrow. If their $55 million quarterback is fully recovered from his wrist\u00a0injury, Cincinnati is a contender. But in addition, I love the way they\u00a0addressed the offensive line, added talent to the receiver corps and\u00a0improved at safety. Don't forget about the Bengals.\n9. Buffalo Bills (-3)\nIn Josh we trust. Hard to come to any other conclusion after Buffalo's\u00a0offseason. The Bills will be a threat as long as Josh Allen is on his game, but\u00a0it's going to be tougher without Stefon Diggs or the long list of veteran\u00a0defenders they had to release. On the bright side, this was a roster in need\u00a0of a reset. It'll be fun to watch Allen lead a newer, younger version of this\u00a0team into the next stage of his career.\n10. Cleveland Browns (-1)\nTheoretically, the Browns have a loaded roster and are getting their starting QB back from injury. Now, Deshaun Watson just needs to actually play like\u00a0the guy they traded the farm to get. If he does, Cleveland is a contender. If\u00a0he doesn't, yikes.\n11. Los Angeles Rams (-1)\nI love so much about what the Rams have done this year. Re-signing Kevin\u00a0Dotson and bringing in Jonah Jackson has their offensive line looking\u00a0formidable. Kamren Curl and Tre'Davious White are nice, affordable signings\u00a0on defense. They added some exciting draft picks. But you're just not going\u00a0to climb in the power rankings when a legend like Aaron Donald retires. Even if the young talent on defense looks promising, there's no replacing a force\u00a0like Donald.\n12. Dallas Cowboys (-4)\u00a0\nLet's be clear: The Cowboys should still be a good team, with a strong chance of making the playoffs. It's just hard to see the improvement from 2023. Dak\u00a0Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons can still take you a long way, but\u00a0the Cowboys lost seven key members of last year's team and haven't done\u00a0much to replace them. Are Eric Kendricks, Ezekiel Elliott and a handful of\u00a0rookies enough to get over the hump?\u00a0\n13. New York Jets (+6)\nCounting on the health of a 40-year-old quarterback recovering from an\u00a0Achilles tear is a scary place to be. That said, I think the Jets have done all\u00a0the right things to get ready for Aaron Rodgers' second attempt in New York. Beefing up the offensive tackle spot with Tyron Smith and Morgan Moses was an amazing decision, and I'm so proud of general manager Joe Douglas for\u00a0insuring those guys with No. 11 overall pick Olu Fashanu. Douglas even\u00a0signed a competent backup quarterback in Tyrod Taylor. That's how you\u00a0protect an aging QB. We know the defense will be top-notch. Now, if\u00a0Rodgers can just deliver the rest.\n14. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+2)\nAgainst all odds, the Bucs brought back almost all the key pieces of a team\u00a0that made a playoff run last year. I never would've guessed Baker Mayfield,\u00a0Mike Evans, Antoine Winfield Jr. and Lavonte David would all re-sign in\u00a0Tampa, but here we are. On top of that, I really dig this draft class, highlighted by an immediate starter in center Graham Barton, who could help the\u00a0run game in a big way.\n15. Chicago Bears (+4)\nNo pressure, Caleb. The defense was great down the home stretch of 2023,\u00a0and now the offense has the No. 1 overall pick at quarterback, a loaded\u00a0receiver corps, a 1,000-yard rusher and a capable offensive line. I don't\u00a0expect Caleb Williams and the new-look Bears to do anything crazy like win\u00a0the division, but I do expect them to be a fun, competitive squad. That'd be a hell of a first step for Chicago.\n16. Miami Dolphins (-4)\nI worry about the Dolphins. The skill positions are as good as it gets, but I'm\u00a0not sold that they improved the offensive line, which was their downfall last\u00a0year. On defense, they lost Christian Wilkins, and both Bradley Chubb and\u00a0Jaelan Phillips are coming off major injuries. Past versions of this team\u00a0haven't been able to hold up over the grind of an 18-week season, and I\u00a0have my doubts about this one.\n17. Atlanta Falcons (+7)\nThe Falcons nearly won the NFC South with middling quarterback play last\u00a0year, so the addition of Kirk Cousins gives them a legit shot to make some noise. I'm going to be confused about the Michael Penix Jr. pick for the rest of my life, but that doesn't change the fact that Atlanta could win 9-plus games in\u00a02024.\n18. Jacksonville Jaguars (-1)\u00a0\nAdding Brian Thomas Jr. offsets the loss of Calvin Ridley. The rookie \u2014 together with Gabe Davis, Christian Kirk, Evan Engram and Travis Etienne \u2014 gives\u00a0Trevor Lawrence a solid group of weapons. I'm still concerned about the Jags' offensive line. And even with Josh Allen signed for the long-term, I'm not\u00a0convinced this defense got much better.\n19. Pittsburgh Steelers (-2)\nThe best thing going in Pittsburgh right now is what's been done along the\u00a0offensive line. If the Steelers' young draft picks play up to their potential, it's\u00a0going to make life much easier on their QB1. We can count on the defense to be stout. How much better does Russell Wilson (or Justin Fields) make you\u00a0feel about the Steelers' ability to score points? I'll say I'm cautiously\u00a0optimistic.\n20. Seattle Seahawks (-6)\nI really love Seattle's first two draft picks. Byron Murphy II and Christian\u00a0Haynes could potentially make the Seahawks much better on the lines. I still\u00a0wonder what Mike Macdonald's long-term vision is, because this feels like a\u00a0team that could transition in 2025.\n21. Indianapolis Colts (-6)\u00a0\nSorry for stating the obvious, but everything in Indy hinges on Anthony\u00a0Richardson. The Colts brought back their key free agents and had a nice\u00a0enough draft, but I don't think they're a better team than last year's unless\u00a0Richardson can continue his upward trajectory \u2014 while staying healthy this\u00a0time.\n[RELATED: Inside Colts QB Anthony Richardson\u2019s rehab, preparations for Year 2]\n22. Arizona Cardinals (no change)\nRome wasn't built in a day. Marvin Harrison Jr. should immediately make Arizona's passing attack much more viable, and I like the addition of Jonah Williams to stabilize the offensive line. But this is still a team counting on a\u00a0lot of young draft picks. Better, but not ready yet.\n23. Minnesota Vikings (+2)\nThe Vikings could be a much better team than this ranking suggests, but it\u00a0all comes down to quarterback play. Is J.J. McCarthy ready to start right\u00a0away? And if he is, how good is he? How will Sam Darnold perform if he's\u00a0tapped to be the starter? It's a really nice roster overall, but the QB spot is\u00a0just too big of a question mark.\n24. Tennessee Titans (+4)\nAt the very least, we'll soon know how good Will Levis is. The Titans spent\u00a0$307 million in free agency, and they also used their No. 7 overall draft pick\u00a0on a franchise left tackle. With an improved offensive line, plus Calvin Ridley\u00a0and Tony Pollard to give the ball to, the main goal for this year should be\u00a0finding out if Levis is a guy they can build around.\n25. New Orleans Saints (+1)\nI really think the Saints could be a solid team with better offensive line play.\u00a0Is it realistic to think they'll get that in 2024? Hard to say. First-round pick\u00a0Taliese Fuaga looks like a badass, but what does the future hold for Ryan\u00a0Ramczyk? Tough to feel good about Derek Carr's prospects without knowing\u00a0more about the guys up front.\n26. Los Angeles Chargers (-3)\nJustin Herbert with Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt protecting him is a solid place\u00a0to start, and I trust Jim Harbaugh to get this moving in the right direction. I\u00a0still ultimately think the Chargers are in the early stages of a multi-year\u00a0rebuild. This offseason has been a strong start, but I think this team is\u00a0another offseason away from making real noise.\n27. Washington Commanders (+1)\nThe Commanders spent a ton of money in free agency and had a boatload of draft capital to spend. That's the benefit of being so terrible that it requires a full\u00a0reboot. I can't say expectations are high for the team, but it's going to be fun to watch Jayden Daniels begin his NFL career with a decent supporting cast\u00a0around him.\n28. Las Vegas Raiders (-6)\nThere's too much talent in Las Vegas for a ranking this low. The Raiders have a feisty defense, now headlined by Christian Wilkins along with Maxx Crosby. Davante Adams is still a top-tier receiver. But how high can the ceiling really\u00a0be without a better option at quarterback? Gardner Minshew was good\u00a0enough to nearly win the AFC South, but something tells me that's not going to\u00a0happen in Patrick Mahomes' division.\n29. New England Patriots (+2)\nYou've got to love the vibes coming out of the draft. The Pats restocked their offense in one weekend, and now we wait to see how well it translates. The\u00a0early guess is that it's not going to look as easy as it does on paper. Is Drake\u00a0Maye even going to start right away over Jacoby Brissett? How quickly can\u00a0these rookie receivers and linemen hit the ground running? The safe bet is\u00a0there are bound to be growing pains for all these young players.\n30. New York Giants (no change)\nMy theory is the Giants are laying the groundwork for 2025. Malik Nabers is\u00a0going to give their offense some much-needed juice, and they made some\u00a0smart offensive line signings. But no matter how this might look with Daniel\u00a0Jones or Drew Lock, I feel comfortable betting that it'll all set the stage for a\u00a0new QB next year.\n31. Denver Broncos (-2)\nWill it be Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham or Zach Wilson starting at quarterback?\u00a0Doesn't that question tell you a lot about what to expect from the Broncos?\u00a0This feels like a season to take some lumps, develop their new quarterback\u00a0and get the disastrous Russell Wilson contract off their books.\n32. Carolina Panthers (no change)\nBryce Young will definitely have help. I think people forgot about the addition of Diontae Johnson, and now adding Xavier Legette and Jonathon Brooks will\u00a0give Young some real-deal difference makers on offense. That said, this is still a team that's missing a lot of pieces \u2014 and, until proven otherwise, we're\u00a0not sure how good Young actually is.\nDavid Helman covers the Dallas Cowboys for FOX Sports and hosts the NFL on FOX podcast.
